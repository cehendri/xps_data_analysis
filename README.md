# The project imports XPS data and performs analysis and fitting for peaks

## XPS data was collected using  a PHI5400 XPS by Christophper Hendricks and Azzam Mansour

*The data has been pre-processed so that binding energies are shifted so that the LiF peak is located at 685 eV
*Column 2 is the 0 Volt battery shifted binding energy
*Column 3 is the 0 Volt battery counts/sec from the hemispherical electron detector
*Column 5 is the 3.4 Volt battery shifted binding energy
*Column 6 is the 3.4 Volt battery counts/sec from the hemispherical electron detector
